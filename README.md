# 3D-Jet-in-Crossflow-JICF-
This project is a part of "Applied Numerical Computation in Engineering 2022" course in Chulalongkorn University. It is the 3D simulation of jet in crossflow (JICF) using Linux terminal to compile and using "Paraview" to visualize. The details and coding are going to be update day-by-day or week-by-week. It is going to take about 1-2 week to complete the project and it may take 3-7 days to run the simulation, go for it!!!
